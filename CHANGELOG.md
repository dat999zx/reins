# Changelog

Format: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com). Versions: [SemVer](https://semver.org).

## Unreleased

- New step kind `end` (`## end`): stops the workflow; steps after it run only when a link jumps to them.
- Blocks is now one pan and zoom workspace: drag the background to pan, wheel to zoom, Shift+drag to box-select. Scratch-style blocks snap into a stack; steps after an `end` are free blocks joined by drawn links. Loose blocks park ideas outside the file. Undo and redo, copy and paste, right-click menus and keyboard routes for every action.
- The Map tab is gone; tabs are Chat, Blocks and Text.

## 0.1.2

- Fix `npm i -g reins-ai`: `yaml` and `picomatch` were installed empty, so `reins` crashed on start. They are now bundled.

## 0.1.1

- Published as `reins-ai` (npm refused `reins`); the command is still `reins`.
- Releases are published from a version tag by CI.

## 0.1.0

First release.

### Workflows
- `.reins.md` format: frontmatter (name, task, budget, `always` rules) and steps `phase`, `say`, `turn`, `run`, `gate`, `verify`, `if` / `else`, `repeat`, `recall`, `store`, `handoff`, `use`.
- Conditions: `tests`, `cmd`, `diff`, `touches`, `same`, `attempts`, `drift`, `done`, `approve`, `llm`, `review`.
- Wires: `next` is a real jump; `on-fail` retries with a budget; a paused link resumes with `allowMore`.
- `whenever <condition>` auto cards and nine live cards (`nudge`, `role`, `guard`, `checkpoint`, `budget`, `stop`, `undo`, `note`, `now`).
- Validator: unknown steps, bad globs, dead wires, unreachable steps. A printer that round-trips the parser.
- Mandatory loop and run budgets; a receipt for every run.

### CLI
- `reins`, `run`, `check`, `print`, `doctor`, `serve`. Claude Code engine, with enforced guards, a trust prompt for commands, and run resume.

### App
- Chat, Canvas, Blocks and Text views of one file, with a Block panel, saved layout, live step state, and the open file and tab restored per folder.
- Native folder picker; two sessions side by side.

### Not yet
- Codex and other engines (Claude Code only).
- Desktop installer.
